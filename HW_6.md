# PyViz HW, The Dashboard

## I created this Dashboard to uncover relationships and patterns in San Francisco's (SFO) housing market.

* In the first tab, I want to give the viewers a way to quanitify all the different neighborhoods historical data. Showing the average rents, prices, and cost of neighborhoods. 

*The second tab is for the visual learner. Showing the locations, and data for individual locations.
